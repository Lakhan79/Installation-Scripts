How to install Jenkins on Ubuntu 20.04
Jenkins is a popular open-source tool for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It allows you to automate the building, testing, and deployment of your software projects. In this blog, we will show you how to install Jenkins on Ubuntu 20.04 using the official Jenkins repository.
Prerequisites
•	A running Ubuntu 20.04 server with sudo privileges
•	A stable internet connection
Steps
1.	Open a terminal and update the system package repository by running:
sudo apt update
Copy
This command ensures that you have the latest versions of the packages available.
2.	Install OpenJDK 11, which is required for Jenkins, by running:
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
Copy
This command installs the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 and its dependencies.
3.	Import the GPG key for the Jenkins repository by running:
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
 /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
Copy
This command downloads the GPG key from the Jenkins website and adds it to the system keyring. The GPG key verifies the integrity of the packages downloaded from the Jenkins repository.
4.	Add the Jenkins repository to the system source list by running:
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
 https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
Copy
This command creates a file named jenkins.list in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory and writes the Jenkins repository URL and the authentication key to it.
5.	Update the system package repository again by running:
sudo apt update
Copy
This command refreshes the cache and makes the system aware of the new Jenkins repository.
6.	Install Jenkins by running:
sudo apt install jenkins -y
Copy
This command installs Jenkins and its dependencies.
7.	Check if Jenkins is installed and running by running:
sudo systemctl status jenkins
Copy
This command displays the status of the Jenkins service. You should see something like this:
● jenkins.service - LSB: Start Jenkins at boot time 
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/jenkins; generated) 
     Active: active (exited) since Wed 2023-05-17 13:45:57 IST; 5s ago 
       Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8) 
    Process: 1234 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/jenkins start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) 

May 17 13:45:57 ubuntu systemd[1]: Starting LSB: Start Jenkins at boot time... 
May 17 13:45:57 ubuntu systemd[1]: Started LSB: Start Jenkins at boot time.
Copy
You have successfully installed Jenkins on Ubuntu 20.04.
